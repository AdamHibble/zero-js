It requires no transpiling, no bable runtimes, and uses the javascript syntax you already know!\r\n\r\nSimply write your functions in plain old jacascript (`POJS`) and watch as they run seamlessly in the browser!\r\n\r\nThis framework was carefully crafted by smitec [(smitec.io)](http://smitec.io) while waiting for an nmp install to finish running.\r\n",
